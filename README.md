# Crawlie (the crawler)

Crawlie is meant to be a simple Elixir library for writing decently-peforming crawlers with minimum effort. It's a work in progress, it doesn't do much yet.

## Usage example

`TODO`

## Configuration

`TODO`

## Planned features

`TODO`

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `crawlie` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:crawlie, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. ~~Ensure `crawlie` is started before your application:~~

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:crawlie]]
    end
    ```
